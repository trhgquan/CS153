	abstract="The last decade of improvement in service offerings over the Internet offers the hope that many kinds of sensitive interactions between strangers can be carried out electronically, without requiring physical transmission of paper credentials to establish trust. In this short paper, we describe one way of converting the current paper-based approach to establishing trust into an electronic approach that minimizes human intervention. We also describe the theoretical and systems issues that are raised by this approach.",

	abstract = {Electronic transactions regularly occur between business partners in separate security domains. Trust negotiation is an approach that provides an open authentication and access-control environment for such transactions, but it is vulnerable to malicious attacks leading to denial of service or leakage of sensitive information. This paper introduces an Adaptive Trust Negotiation and Access Control (ATNAC) framework to solve these problems. The framework combines two existing systems, TrustBuilder and GAA-API, to create a system with more flexibility and responsiveness to attack than either system currently provides.},
