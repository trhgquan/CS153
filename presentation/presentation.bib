	abstract="The last decade of improvement in service offerings over the Internet offers the hope that many kinds of sensitive interactions between strangers can be carried out electronically, without requiring physical transmission of paper credentials to establish trust. In this short paper, we describe one way of converting the current paper-based approach to establishing trust into an electronic approach that minimizes human intervention. We also describe the theoretical and systems issues that are raised by this approach.",
