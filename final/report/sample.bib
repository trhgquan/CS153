	abstract="The last decade of improvement in service offerings over the Internet offers the hope that many kinds of sensitive interactions between strangers can be carried out electronically, without requiring physical transmission of paper credentials to establish trust. In this short paper, we describe one way of converting the current paper-based approach to establishing trust into an electronic approach that minimizes human intervention. We also describe the theoretical and systems issues that are raised by this approach.",

	abstract = {Electronic transactions regularly occur between business partners in separate security domains. Trust negotiation is an approach that provides an open authentication and access-control environment for such transactions, but it is vulnerable to malicious attacks leading to denial of service or leakage of sensitive information. This paper introduces an Adaptive Trust Negotiation and Access Control (ATNAC) framework to solve these problems. The framework combines two existing systems, TrustBuilder and GAA-API, to create a system with more flexibility and responsiveness to attack than either system currently provides.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present {rm{Trust}}{hbox{-}}{cal{X}}, a comprehensive XML-based [12] framework for trust negotiations, specifically conceived for a peer-to-peer environment. Trust negotiation is a promising approach for establishing trust in open systems like the Internet, where sensitive interactions may often occur between entities at first contact, with no prior knowledge of each other. The framework we propose takes into account all aspects related to negotiations, from the specification of the profiles and policies of the involved parties to the selection of the best strategy to succeed in the negotiation. {rm{Trust}}{hbox{-}}{cal{X}} presents a number of innovative features, such as the support for protection of sensitive policies, the use of trust tickets to speed up the negotiation, and the support of different strategies to carry on a negotiation. In this paper, besides presenting the language to encode security information, we present the system architecture and algorithms according to which negotiations can take place.},
